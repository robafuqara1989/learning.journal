"my name is Roba growth mindset affects my life in many sites of it :
1.haven’t managed to get things together, I’ve procrastinated and wasted time,
and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.

2.The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility,
and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

3.For a long time, I was fiercely jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent.
But, with the help of our culture of openness and honesty,
I was able to understand how the work I do relates to the work of my peers,
and how it all comes together to create something awesome.
